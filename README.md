# Pomodoro
This is a repository for Pomodoro technique. 
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves working on a task. This technique is based on fixed time intervals, with longer breaks after four consecutive work intervals. The idea is that the timer creates a sense of urgency, so you know you only have pre defined duration to make as much progress as possible. 

The technology used is HTML, Java Script, CSS. This is simple interface which has been created for users to keep check on the time during the task. Users will have the following features.
1) Add Task.
2) Delete Task.
3)  Start/Pause/Reset timer.

In the end user can save the tasks with status to the local drive. When user will click on the save button then it will download file to local hard drive.
